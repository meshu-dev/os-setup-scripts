# MacOS setup script

This setup script was created to setup, configure and install software that I use on a fresh new install of MacOS.

The macos-setup.sh file installs all the applications that I use via [Brew](https://brew.sh/) which is a package manger for MacOS.

## Usage
1. Download the macos-setup.sh file
2. Open up the Terminal application
3. Go to the file directory containing the macos-setup.sh file
4. Run the following command...  
    ```sh macos-setup.sh```
5. Wait till the script has finished running

## Changing packages
The packages available from Brew can be found at [https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh).

Simply type in the name of the package into the search textfield that shows the "Search Homebrew" text.
